        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Duplessis' Diner is a sustainable local diner located in Worcester, MA. It was created by my father, who recently passed away and handed the company over to me. Our family-run business has been serving the community since 1999.</p>

        <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
        <p>We pride ourselves on using locally sourced products and crops to ensure each customer enjoys a fresh, healthy, and delicious meal. Additionally, we do not cook with any seed oils, guaranteeing a top-notch dining experience.</p>
